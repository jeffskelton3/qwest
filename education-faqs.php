				Once you have retained the Qwest Credit team to optimize your credit report your personal credit advocate engages in an initial analysis of your file to determine the optimal course of action.  Once this determination has been made by your personal credit advocate they will contact you and share with you their results and offer their recommended course of action.  Once you have approved the course of action, your advocate will immediately begin implementing the dispute process using all of their knowledge and experience to professionally draft and send correspondence directly to all three credit bureaus, the collection agencies, and original creditors.  The manner in which all correspondence is drafted has been carefully crafted over many years to ensure that both the bureaus and your creditors MUST take notice.
			</p>
			<p>
				The precise nature of the correspondence that is sent on your behalf is a key ingredient to the success of your case.  The same Federal laws that protect consumers have also left open several large loopholes that provide credit bureaus and creditors the ability to deprive you of many of the protections that the law was intended to provide you with.  The manner in which the laws have been drafted provide the bureaus with the ability to refuse your requests to investigate a dispute under several different circumstances.  In fact, over the years it has become quite apparent that a very large percentage of self-drafted consumer letters are simply disregarded and ignored by the credit bureaus.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once our professionally drafted correspondence reaches the credit bureau, the law requires them to fully investigate the claim within a 30 day period and either elect to verify or delete the disputed information.  Also, during this time, we will be sending additional correspondence to the collection agencies and original creditors.  While the bureaus are investigating, we are demanding additional documentation, required by law, from them as well.  Upon the conclusion of the bureaus investigation a copy of their results accompanied by a new copy of your credit report will be sent directly to you.  Once this updated information is received we ask that you make a copy of the information for your own personal records and send the originals directly to us.  Based on a careful analysis of this new information our team will continue to fight to optimize your credit until you are 100% satisfied with the results.
			</p>
			<p>
				Federal law requires that every item on your credit report must be accurate, verifiable and non-misleading in order for it to be properly presented on your credit report.  If the bureau investigation reveals that the disputed item is only partially inaccurate, the bureau has the option of changing the disputed item to reflect it accurately.  However, in most situations the items that are being disputed cannot be verified for numerous reasons such as a lack of information or the creditors simply determining that it is not worth dedicating their resources to supply the required verifying information.  It is for these reasons that with proper enforcement of the available Federal laws the Qwest Credit team can optimize your credit.
			</p>
			<h2 id="Q2"> <strong>Is it legal for me to have you dispute items?</strong>
			</a>
		</h2>
		<p>
			Absolutely.  The United States Congress, through the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, has specifically granted you the right to legally dispute items on your credit report.  Credit bureaus spend a lot of time and energy attempting to convince consumers that they do not have the right to challenge items on their credit reports, but this is simply not true.  The ability to dispute items on your credit report was granted to all consumers by the United States Congress for the purpose of providing consumers with the ability to protect their most important financial asset, their credit.

			<strong>How long does the process take?</strong>
		</a>
	</h2>
	<p>
		It would be misleading to guarantee a precise outcome or time frame for a particular case.  What the Qwest Credit team can offer is an estimated time of the results you can expect to see.  Although the results of each individual case can vary, we feel confident stating that a large percentage of our client's see dramatic results within 45 days from our initial contact.  We can say that our average time for each case is 4-6 months.
	</p>
	<p>
		Your initial and continued involvement plays a significant factor in how quickly we can optimize your credit.  Crucial to our process is your continued participation in the areas that you control, namely providing us with updated credit reports and all coreespondence received from the bureaus.  The complexity of your case and the cooperation of all those whom we correspond with on your behalf also vary the speed at which we can achieve providing you the financial freedom you deserve.
	</p>
	<h2 id="Q4">
		<strong>Can deleted items reappear?</strong>
	</a>
</h2>
<p>
	In very rare circumstances a creditor may verify information that was previously deleted from your credit report.  However, under Federal law a credit bureau is required to inform you prior to re-listing an item that was previously deleted.  Rest assured that Federal law has made it extremely difficult for a credit bureau to get a deleted item re-listed.  With that being said, while it is possible, it is highly unlikely that this will take place.  You can also be assured that in the rare event that a previously deleted item is re-listed on your credit report we will continue to be here to service your needs and ensure your legal rights are being properly enforced.
</p>
<h2 id="Q5">
	<strong>What about paying my bills?</strong>
</a>
</h2>
<p>
Regardless if an item is deleted from your credit report or not, if the underlying debt is truly owed you still remain responsible for paying it.  Having the item removed from your credit report is only a temporary solution.  If the debt is in fact accurate and owed, the collection agency may still have the option to continue collection activity.
</p>
<h2 id="Q6">
<strong>Is it true that if I pay my bill my credit will improve?</strong>
</a>
</h2>
<p>
While this would be great it it were true, the reality is that it may be false.  Paying down your debt may not result in removing negative items from your credit report.  In reality when you do actually pay the debt your creditor reports the payment as late and the seven year time period re-starts.
</p>
<p>
The harsh reality is that a current negative listing is not treated any better than an unpaid negative listing.  This results in the brutal reality that you get no favorable treatment with regards to your credit report for doing the right thing by bringing your account current.
</p>
<p>
The best solution is to let us work to optimize your credit while at the same time you attempt to fulfill your payments obligations to your creditors that can prove the debts are legitimate.
</p>
<h2 id="Q7">
<strong>Are your services guaranteed?</strong>
</a>
</h2>
<p>
While it would be unethical for any organization to guarantee that it will achieve a certain result, what we do guarantee is that our team will work on your case with the utmost diligence.  Our success is measured by the results that we acieve for our clients.
</p>
<p>
Our confidence in the results you can expect are so high that we offer a FULL REFUND POLICY*

<strong>Does it matter where I live?</strong>
</a>
</h2>
<p>
The location of your residence does not play a factor in our ability to provide services to you.  The Qwest Credit team is limited to the pre-litigation enforcement of consumer rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act and various other Federal laws.  The rights that are enforced on your behalf are Federal in nature, and subsequently are available to most, regardless of the particular state you live in.  Please note that some states may have other rights and remedies available that we will not be able to provide you assistance with.
