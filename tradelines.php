		<h2>Seasoned Tradelines</h2>
		<p>We offer our clients an opportunity to "piggyback" off of our portfolio of seasoned tradelines by adding them as an authorized user. This gives our clients the opportinity to increase their credit scores dramatically by adding a seasoned account with perfect payment history to their credit file. The seasoned tradelines we have in our portfolio are a great way for our clients to enhance the three main factors affecting their credit score (<a href="/credit-tips.php">credit tips</a>), which leads to dramatic score increases.</p>
		<h2>Authorized User Accounts</h2>
		<p>Once added as an authorized user to an account, our clients inherit the positive payment history associated with that particular credit card. Our clients do not have any legal obligation to that account, nor do they have spending ability on that account. Out portfolio of cards have limits that range from 2k-30k, are a minimum of 2 years old, have perfect payment histories, and minimal balances. We deal directly with the cardholders, leaving no questions which cards our clients will be added to. Contrary to what the credit bureaus would like you to believe, authorized user accounts continue to work, and are the quickest and most effective way to improve your credit score. Average results are increases of 25-50 points per tradeline added.</p>
		<h2>Process</h2>
		<p>Within 7-10 days of being added as an authorized user, our clients receive confirmation that they have been placed on that particular account. Typically it will take 30-45 days for the tradelines to appear on the credit report. Once reporting, the credit score improvement will reflect immediately.
